# Collaborative Web Project (GitHub + HTML)

### 🎯 Objective
To practice real teamwork on GitHub by creating individual HTML profile pages inside a shared repository using Bootstrap. This lab demonstrates how to add collaborators, commit changes, and sync updates within a small team.

---

## 🧩 Group Structure
Each group will consist of 3 members:
groupleader/
teammate1/
teammate2/
Each member works only inside their assigned folder and creates a personal webpage named index.html.

---

## 🧭 Instructions

### 🥇 Step 1: Fork and Clone
1. The Group Leader forks the instructor’s repository:  
    https://github.com/AdnanAdj/Collaborative-Web-Project
2. The leader then clones their fork using GitHub Desktop:  
   - Go to File → Clone Repository → URL  
   - Paste their fork link (not the instructor’s)  
   - Choose a local folder → Clone

---

### 🥈 Step 2: Add Collaborators
- On GitHub, the leader goes to: Settings → Collaborators → Add people  
- Add both teammates by their GitHub usernames or emails.  
- Each teammate must accept the invitation from their email or GitHub notifications.

---

### 🥉 Step 3: Create and Edit Folders
Each team member:  
1. Opens the cloned repo folder locally.  
2. Goes to their assigned folder (groupleader/, teammate1/, or teammate2/).  
3. Copies the provided sample.html file into their folder.  
4. Renames it to index.html.  
5. Edits the HTML with:  
   - Their name and details  
   - Profile image  
   - Skills and teammates list  
   - Any creative content they like  
(Open the file in a browser to preview changes.)

---

### 🚀 Step 4: Commit and Push
Each member:  
1. Opens GitHub Desktop.  
2. Checks their changed files.  
3. Adds a summary like: Added my Bootstrap HTML profile page  
4. Clicks Commit to main  
5. Clicks Push origin to upload to GitHub.

---

### 🔄 Step 5: Pull Updates
After all members have pushed their work:  
- Everyone clicks Fetch origin → Pull origin to sync the latest updates from teammates.  
- All three folders (groupleader/, teammate1/, teammate2/) should now appear in the repository.

---

## ✅ Deliverables
Each group must submit:  
- Link to their team repository (leader’s repo)  
- Screenshot showing all three folders on GitHub  
- Screenshot of each member’s HTML page in browser  
- Screenshot of GitHub Desktop commit
